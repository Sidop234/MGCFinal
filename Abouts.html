     <h1 align="center" > Our Objective</h1>
     <p style="margin:30px 160px "> If one has to manually classify the songs or music, one has to listen to a lot of songs and then select the genre.
         This is not only time-consuming but also difficult.
         The objective of automating the music classification is to make the selection of songs quick and less cumbersome.</p>
     <p style="margin: 20px 160px">
         A music genre classifier is a software program that predicts the genre of a piece of music in audio format. These devices are used for tasks such as automatically tagging music for distributors such as Spotify and Billboard and determining appropriate background music for events.
The ambiguity of genre classification makes machine intelligence well-suited to this task. Given enough audio data, of which large amounts can be easily harvested from freely available music online, machine learning can observe and make predictions using these ill-defined patterns.
The goal of this project is to build a proof-of-concept music genre classifier using a deep learning approach that can correctly predict the genre and confidence level of Western music from popular candidate genres (classical, jazz, rap, rock, etc.. ).
